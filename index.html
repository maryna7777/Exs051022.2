        <p class="pa1">The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George
            Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to
            whether they were the first to reach the top.</p>
        <h2>Everest</h2>
        <p>Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰;
            pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal
            sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow
            height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali
            authorities.</p>

            <h2>Everest</h2>
            <p>
                Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main
                climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route")
                and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the
                standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as
                hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of 2019, over 300 people have died on Everest, many
                of whose bodies remain on the mountain.

                OThe first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did
                not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north
                ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921
                reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to
                8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft).

            Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast
            ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss
            expedition.

            <h4>Name</h4>
            <p>
                The Tibetan name for Everest is Qomolangma (ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ, lit. "Holy Mother"). The name was first
                recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of
                Qing China, and then appeared as Tchoumour Lancma on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French
                geographer D'Anville based on the former map.[7] It is also popularly romanised as Chomolungma and (in
                Wylie) as Jo-mo-glang-ma.
